# CVE-2020-1337

CVE-2020-1337 is a bypass of (PrintDemon) CVE-2020-1048’s patch, made to remediate an Elevation of Privileges (EoP)\Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) vulnerability affecting the Windows’ Print Spooler Service. 
My version of the exploit is a completely different bypass (from the one presented at Black Hat) and does not require specially-crafted *.SHD files. 
The vulnerability does require low privilege access and for the spooler service to restart.
The patch is expected to appear in Microsoft’s patch Tuesday (11th August 2020).

Vulnerability description, root cause analysis and PoC code will be released (following MSRC responsible disclosure guidelines) on 16th of September on https://voidsec.com/cve-2020-1337-printdemon-is-dead-long-live-printdemon/
